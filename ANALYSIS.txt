Theoretically, the timing should be O(n^3) because you look n points three times.

Emperical Analysis:

10 Points --
Elapsed Time: 987000 nanoseconds

8 Points -- 
Elapsed Time: 665000 nanoseconds

5 Points --
Elapsed Time: 534000 nanoseconds

2 Points --
Elapsed Time: 10000 nanoseconds

The discrepencies are due to the overhead on the operations performed by the program.
